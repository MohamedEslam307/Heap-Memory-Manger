 * Resizes a previously allocated memory block.
 *
 * This function attempts to resize the memory block pointed to by `ptr`. The new size is specified by `size` bytes.
 * It offers a way to modify the amount of memory allocated for a given block without having to manually free and reallocate.
 *
 * There are three main cases handled by `realloc`:
 *  - If `ptr` is NULL, it behaves exactly like `malloc(size)`.
 *  - If `size` is zero, it frees the memory pointed to by `ptr` and returns NULL.
 *  - If `size` is larger than the current allocation, it allocates a new block of memory, copies the data from the old block,
 *    and frees the old block. Otherwise, it returns the original pointer (`ptr`).
 *
 * @param ptr    A pointer to the previously allocated memory block, or NULL if requesting a new allocation.
 * @param size   The new size of the memory block in bytes. If `size` is zero, the function frees the memory pointed to by `ptr`.
 *
 * @return  A pointer to the reallocated memory block on success, NULL on failure.
 *          Failure can occur if there is not enough memory available for the requested size, or if `ptr` is invalid.

 * If successful, it initializes all bytes in the allocated block to zero. This ensures that
 * any uninitialized data is set to a known value, which can help prevent security vulnerabilities
 * and unexpected behavior.
 *
 * @param nmemb  The number of elements to allocate. If `nmemb` is zero, the function returns NULL.
 * @param size   The size of each element in bytes. If `size` is zero, the function returns NULL.
 *
 * @return  A pointer to the allocated memory block on success, NULL on failure.
